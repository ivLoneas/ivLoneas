## About
Machine Learning Engineer with 5+ years of commercial experience across cybersecurity, NLP, and medical engineering. End-to-end ownership from requirements and data collection to model development, deployment, and monitoring. Hands-on with LLMs for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multi-agent pipelines. Comfortable in teams from 2 to 30 people. Strong DS/ML foundations backed by a STEM degree.

Beyond ML, Iâ€™ve built web systems end to end: 3D client-side graphics with Three.js (rendering/perf), and backend services in Kotlin to deliver new functionality and streamline workflows.
