## About
Machine Learning Engineer with 5+ years of commercial experience across cybersecurity, NLP, and medical engineering. End-to-end ownership from requirements and data collection to model development, deployment, and monitoring. Hands-on with LLMs for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multi-agent pipelines. Comfortable in teams from 2 to 30 people. Strong DS/ML foundations backed by a STEM degree.

Beyond ML, I’ve built web systems end to end: 3D client-side graphics with Three.js (rendering/perf), and backend services in Kotlin to deliver new functionality and streamline workflows.

### Sberbank Technologies — *ML Engineer Contractor*  
**Jun 2020 – Jun 2021** • 1 yr
- Designed a **lightweight challenge-response** step to catch account takeovers *after* correct logins.  
- Quantified security impact: set **hard ceilings** on attacker guess rates and identified conditions where the control adds the most value.  
- Cut computational complexity by **1,000×** (≈1e9 → ≈1e6 candidate cases), turning research into an approach a risk team can evaluate quickly.  
- Delivered a **rollout playbook**: which questions to ask, how many options to show, and how to tune fraud reduction vs. customer experience.
